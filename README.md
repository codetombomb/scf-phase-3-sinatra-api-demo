# User Stories
While thinking about the absolute basics of this application from a users point of view, I would like to be able to:

- Sign up and login
- Select a difficulty setting (Hard, Med, Easy) that adjusts the number of cards shown. Maybe these could be in game weapons that can represent the difficulty like:
    - Rusty sword - easy
    - Falcon Bow - med
    - Master Sword - hard
- Start the game by clicking on and flipping a card
- Keep track of the number of total moves and wrong moves
- If a wrong move is made, a heart container is emptied.
    - If all heart containers are empty, the game is over
